## IFY 
### (I might add)

- Show battery (i dont think so)
- Center mono space chars when editing

## Lot of Work 
### (I want to add but it will be a lot of work and undertaking)

- Optimize
- Fix implicit multiplication
- Finish degree parsing in `mathparsing.c`

# Done

- Read and parse math expressions - [tinyexpr](https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr/tree/master)
- Fix deleting with multiple lines of numbers
- Save value to selected
- Collapse to one string
- Replace other values to `?` when edit and save one
- Swap labels caps to lower and lower to caps
- Add error screen on bad set
- Make `^2` just type `^2`
- Add Tri1 and Tri2 for if multiple triangle answers
    - Add Tri1 and Tri2 to tips
    - Add locking of set on Tri2 values
    - Add if editing Tri2 values and a value of Tri1 is set that set them to cannot set
- Solving
    - SSS
    - SAS
    - ASA
    - AAS
    - ASS
- Lock show Tri2 if don't have it
- Clamp position of the labels
- Do something about deg and rad when entering
- When save exit
- Alert the user if they try to solve with a negative value
- Alert if triangle invalid
- Set values for Tri2
- Make enter key a shortcut to like set and save maybe even edit
- Add deg and rad indicator in the right corner when editing a value
- Make it so if you clear to make it unset it will no longer unset all on setting one
- Make second clear reset whole thing like unset all values of Tri1
- Debate changing save to solve or solve (I changed it)
- Disable degree till it works
- Factor in all points to make the multi-triangle look better on mod calc
- Shift X and Y to fit
- Add extra data like area and perimeter
